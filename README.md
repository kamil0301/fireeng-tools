# fireeng-tools

Scripts in this repository were written to support fire safety engineers with their
computer work.
Most of them are created to handle computer modelling of fire, evacuation and structures in more efficient way.

Scripts are grouped with categories, as listed below. Some of them use
each other as an external packages. Thus, it is recommended to clone or download
whole repository.


* `structures` - structural fire engineering with SAFIRÂ®, pre and postprocessing, simulations running;

* `evacuation` - pre and postprocessing of evacuation simulations with Pathfinder/FDS+Evac;

* `CFD` - postprocessing of CFD fire simulations with FDS.


This repository will be extended with new scripts and ideas soon.

Feel free to use them at your own risk in any way you want. Please, 
don't forget to share your ideas here by pull requests or reporting issues.
Any suggestions and contribution of any kind would be very appreciated.
