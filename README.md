Simple tools for fire structural engineering, which I use to make the design process easier.

Most of them are intended to be used with SAFIR® - fire structural code by University of Liege, Belgium.
Those scripts are not a part of the software. Neverthless, some can be used generally to structural fire modelling. Feel free to use them as you want and don't forget to share your ideas here.
I would greatly appreciate any suggestions and contribution of any kind.

This repository will be extended with new scripts and ideas.



* `get_in.py` - picking IN files from GiD catalogues adn putting them into one directory;

* `section_temp.py` - calculating mean temperature from TEM results;

* `area2lineload.py` - changing area load to distributed beam load.
