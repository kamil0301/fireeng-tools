# structures-tools
Simple tools for fire structural engineering, which makes the design process easier.

Most of them are intended to be used with SAFIR® - fire structural code by University of Liege, Belgium.
Those scripts are not a part of the software. Neverthless, some can be used generally to structural fire modelling.

* `safir_tools.py` - pre and postprocess of SAFIR® simulations

* `get_in.py` - picking IN files from GiD catalogues adn putting them into one directory

* `section_temp.py` - calculating mean temperature from TEM results

* `area2lineload.py` - changing area load to distributed beam load
